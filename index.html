            <h2>Why Lisbon?</h2>
            <h3>Lisbon, the city of seven hills</h3>
            <p>
              The legend has it that Lisbon was named Olissipo by the Romans,
              for its resemblance to the Roman capital. Just like Rome, Lisbon
              began its life as a humble settlement nestled among seven hills.
              However, it wasn't until the 17th century, in the writing of Frey
              Nicolao d'Oliveira, that Lisbon came to be called 'a cidade das
              sete colinas' - the city of seven hills.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can still see traces of ancient Lisbon today. Beyond the array
              of shops with international brands, peaceful streetside cafes
              selling the iconic pastel de nata and world class restaurants with
              a variety of global cuisine, you can still wander the seven hills
              and see the city from above, taking in the rolling terracotta
              rooftops, the whitewashed walls and on the horizon, the soft blue
              sea.
